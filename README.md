# Apelang: The Primate Way of Communication

 **Welcome, fellow primates, to Apelang!**  
Before there was *Humanlang* (that fancy language with networking and logic at [humanlang](https://github.com/duongddinh/humanlang)), and even before Apelang itself, there was something **even more prehistoric**, [**DinoLang**](https://github.com/duongddinh/dinolang).

Apelang is a direct **evolution of DinoLang**, a fossil-fuelled toy language from a time when variables were declared with "FOSSIL" and strings were ROARed into the digital void. DinoLang predates Apelang by **several geological epochs**. Apelang is basically a newborn mammal by comparison.

Apelang modernizes Dino's prehistoric grunts into **tribes, trees, and swinging loops**, with structured syntax, string support, modules, error handling, and even data structures. But don‚Äôt worry, it's still 99.8% banana-powered.

Apelang is a **prehistoric programming language**.  
Forget your high-level abstractions and complex frameworks. Apelang operates on pure, unfiltered primate instinct. It‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs raw, and surprisingly very effective for tasks that involve a lot of swinging, asking, and printing trees.

## Getting Started (For the Less Evolved)

You‚Äôll need a **C compiler** (`gcc` or `clang`) and `make`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duongddinh/apelang.git
cd apelang
make
````

---

## Global Installation

Make `apeslang` available from anywhere with:

```bash
sudo mv apeslang /usr/local/bin
```

OR, even easier:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The `install.sh` script:

* Builds the `apeslang` binary
* Installs it to `/usr/local/bin`
* Verifies installation

After that, you can use `apeslang` anywhere in your terminal!

---

## üçå Banana Package Manager

To make sharing and using code even easier, Apelang comes with a simple package manager called `apebanana`. It lets you fetch community-made modules directly from the [banana-modules repository](https://github.com/duongddinh/banana-modules).

### Installing a Module

You can install any available module from the tribe's collection. For example, to install a module for math utilities:

```bash
apebanana install max
```

This will download `max.ape` into your current directory. You can then use it in your code with the `summon` keyword

## Developer Tools: REPL & Disassembler
Apelang comes with powerful tools for interactive development and debugging.

### Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
For quick experiments or learning the language, start Apelang in interactive mode. It keeps your variables in memory until you exit.
```
apeslang repl
```
You'll be greeted with a `>> prompt`.
```
Apeslang Interactive REPL. Type 'exit' to quit.
>> ape x = 5
>> tree x ooh 2
7
>> ape y = "hello"
>> tree y ooh " ape"
hello ape
>> exit
```
### Bytecode Viewer (Disassembler)
Ever wonder what your Ape-speak looks like to the machine? You can decompile your .apb files into a human-readable (and ape-commentated) format. This is great for debugging or understanding how the VM works.

First, compile a file:
```
apeslang compile your_script.ape
```
Then, disassemble it:
```
apeslang disassemble your_script.apb
```
Example: A file containing tree 10 ooh 5 would produce:
```
== your_script.apb: The Ape Scrolls ==
0000 OP_PUSH          NUMBER 10
0009 OP_PUSH          NUMBER 5
0018 OP_ADD           ; gather more bananas
0019 OP_PRINT         ; ape screeches about bananas
0020 OP_NIL           ; nil, the absence of bananas
0021 OP_RETURN        ; ape returns to the tribe's canopy
```

## ü¶ç Installing the ApeLang VS Code Extension

## From Marketplace

Install directly from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace:

üîó [duongddinh.ape on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=duongddinh.ape)

### Steps:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for: `duongddinh.ape`
4. Click **Install**

Or via terminal:

```bash
code --install-extension duongddinh.ape
```

## Advanced Ape Knowledge

### Bunch (Array)

```ape
ape myBunch = [10, "banana", true]
tree myBunch[1] # Prints: banana
myBunch[0] = 99
tree myBunch
```

### Canopy (Map)

```ape
ape myCanopy = {"name": "Koko", "age": 5}
tree myCanopy["name"]
myCanopy["age"] = 6
```

### Tumble / Catch (Error Handling)

```ape
tumble {
  tree "Trying something risky..."
  ape fail = 10 ooh "banana" # Type error!
} catch (err) {
  tree "Caught an error!"
  tree err
}
```

### Summon (Modules)

```ape
summon "helpers.ape"
tree helperVar
sayHelloFromHelper("Koko")
```

### Jungle Scrolls (File I/O)

Apes can now record their wisdom for future generations or read ancient knowledge from found scrolls.

Create a new scroll and inscribe some wisdom
```
ape path = "ancient_scroll.txt"
ape wisdom = "A banana in hand is worth two in the tree."
inscribe(path, wisdom)
```
Later, another ape can forage for this wisdom
```
ape found_wisdom = forage(path)
tree "The ancient scroll says: " ooh found_wisdom
```

## Compile & Run

### Compile a .ape file to Ape Bytecode (.apb):

```bash
apeslang compile hellobanana.ape
```

Output:

```
Compilation successful. ü¶çüçå
```

### Run the compiled bytecode:

```bash
apeslang run hellobanana.apb
```

##  Apelang vs. Humanlang

While Humanlang, with its modern Wi-Fi era, creates advanced networking capabilities and runs on fancy interpreters. Apelang is a much more less grounded language. Apelang is a compiled language, meaning your ape code is translated directly into raw, efficient bytecode that the VM executes. There's no middle-ape interpreter like THE TALKING SNAKE; it's a direct connection to the machine's primal core. This also means, unlike its futuristic descendant, Apelang doesn't concern itself with the like of networking or the internet. Our apes communicate through shouts, gestures. If you want to connect to other apes, you'll have to do it the old-fashioned way: by swinging over to their tree.


###  Apelang vs. Humanlang vs. DinoLang: A Tale of Three Epochs

- **DinoLang** is raw binary driven by integers and yelling.
- **Apelang** builds on DinoLang with loops, scopes, strings, modules, and basic error handling.
- **Humanlang** is the sleek, Wi-Fi-enabled descendent, more evolved, but less hairy.

Each speaks to a different era in evolutionary coding. Choose based on your brain size, tool preference, and number of bananas nearby.

##  Known Bugs (a.k.a. ‚ÄúUnpredictable Ape Behavior‚Äù)

* Sometimes the compiler throws a banana peel at you. Try again.
* The VM might go on a spontaneous swinging spree. It's not a bug, it's enrichment.
* Error messages are in ‚ÄúApe-speak‚Äù and may require interpretation.

Found a bug? Got a new banana idea? Fork and PR. We love more apes in the tribe!

## Good luck, and happy swinging!
